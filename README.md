# Summary
Our goal was to create a scenario where we would have a roomba navigate a course that had pillars and "holes" that we couldn't bump into or go over. We also couldn't go outside the area as well.
We had to make it to an end goal that we set ourselves. 
This is the scenario our group came up with. 
This project was simulating an invasion on mars where the United States had to assasinate the leader alien with an assasination bot which was our robot the roomba.

## Role
My role in the project was making sure that the robot didn't turn too much when the keys to turn were pressed. There were many issues with the roomba where it wouldn't turn exactly 90 degrees in the direction pressed. 
I also made sure that the robot would be able to detect edges using different shades of white and black as filters since that is how the edge detection was going to be simulated. 
Since I wasn't controlling the robot and somebody else was the pilot I would record any mistakes in the test trial runs that we made. 

## Skills/Knowledge

I am not the greatest when it comes to programming so there was a lot of learning that I had to do with programming. I mostly got help from other classmates and my group. The major skill I learned was being able to navigate the long documentation that the Roomba had.
Being able to find what we needed quick was a crucial skill especially when there are over a thousand pages of documentation.
